 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

[For brevity, this is a shortened version of the license. The full GPL-3.0 license text should be used in practice.]

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
